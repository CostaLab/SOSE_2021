## Analysis of ATAC-seq data

### Aims
In this script, we will show you how to analysis NGS data from open chromatin, including read alignment, peak calling and motif matching. We will use ATAC-seq for MPP (SRR1533863) and B (SRR1533847) cells from GEO with accession GSE26328. We assume that all tools have been installed properly.
